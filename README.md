**Capstone Group 2:** Sylvia, Clive, Ezekiel, Brenda, Isaiah  
**Date:** June 2025

---

## Business Context & Problem

- Traditional loyalty programs are generic and poorly targeted.
- Result in low engagement, inefficient promotions, and declining retention.
- Goal: Use AI to personalize loyalty strategies for Kenyan supermarkets.

---

## Project Objectives

1. Segment customers using behavioral data.
2. Predict customer churn.
3. Identify high-value customers.

---

## Data Overview

- `customer_info.csv`: Demographics and customer metadata.
- `POS_Transactions.csv`: Transaction details including basket size and spend.
- Combined and engineered into RFM features and churn labels.

---

## Methodology

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
- Churn prediction with classification models.
- Customer segmentation with KMeans clustering.

---

## Churn Prediction Results

### Confusion Matrix

## Business Insights

- Identify and prioritize high-value segments for tailored offers.
- Intervene early with customers predicted to churn.
- Allocate marketing budget efficiently using customer tiers.
